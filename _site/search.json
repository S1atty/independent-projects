    "text": "Amount and quality of health services received vary substantially across different regions and subgroups within. The cause of this variation does not appear to be a result of differences in social-determinants, and estimates show that 33% of expenditures are unnecessary nor improve population health1. Moreover, in 2021, 5% of the population accounted for nearly half (48.4%) of total health expenditures in the United States2. High-Need High-Cost Patients have been the focus of utilization tracking by all stakeholders. There has been no formal definition to this population, but it is understood by most health experts that 1) they represent a small subset of the population and 2) disproportionately have higher spending than their counterparts. 3The ability to clearly define this subset of the population, observe their health needs, and analyze differences in utilization, spending, and quality of care across various factors and geographic regions can provide additional insight to US health expenditures, drive actionable change, and produce targeted initiatives. The Fee for Service Geographic Variation User File was created by the CMS in efforts to explain the underlying variation in resource use among Medicare beneficiaries across regions and physician practice patterns. It is foundational on CMS’ Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW), a data set containing 100% of Medicare beneficiaries’ enrolled in the fee-for-service claims as well as other enrollment types from 2014-2022. For this reason, it is acknowledged that this is census data. Therefore, generalizations in the form of hypothesis testing and statistical inferences are not used in this analysis. Any observable differences in the graphics or summary statistics have been concluded as differences in the population; standard error(s) measurements have been subsequently omitted."
