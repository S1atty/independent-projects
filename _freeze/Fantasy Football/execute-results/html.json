For those individuals that would not classify themselves as ffanatics, it's probably annoying - *it's annoying for all of us*. Pretty consistently there will behavior from fans that range from DMs to athletes, verbal assaults to close friends, damaged property, and public humiliation. Who realistically has the mental endurance to only discuss a single topic over an extended period of time for something they're not physically involved in? It's those with passion, and although I am not passionate about football (nor justify the aforementioned behavior), it will be my first of hopefully many Fantasy Football leagues. If there's one thing I am passionate about, it's tilting the odds in my favor. Usually that's in the form of taking a creative line on the felt on a 2/5 reg by extracting max value with 67s on a low connected board in a 4! pot as the preflop aggressor. Balance and discipline is the name of the game though, and who are we if we don't apply the same approach to all areas in life...\n\n\n# Data Set\n\nThe data contains in-game and Fantasy Football Points per Reception stats by NFL player from 2016 - 2023 for all 17 games of the regular season. Most leagues use a points per reception based metric to calculate fantasy points, or `FantasyPointsPPR.` Before converting to fantasy points, in-game stats may be weighted or counted differently. My league adopted the following criterion: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Variable.Name           |Scoring..Points.                   | Scoring..Points..1|\n|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------|------------------:|\n|Completions             |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|Attempts                |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|PassingYards            |1 point per 25 passing yards       |               0.04|\n|PassingTDs              |4 points per passing touchdown     |               4.00|\n|Interceptions           |-2 points per interception         |              -2.00|\n|RushingAttempts         |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|RushingYards            |1 point per 10 rushing yards       |               0.10|\n|RushingTDs              |6 points per rushing touchdown     |               6.00|\n|Targets                 |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|Receptions              |1 point per reception (PPR format) |               1.00|\n|ReceivingYards          |1 point per 10 receiving yards     |               0.10|\n|ReceivingTDs            |6 points per receiving touchdown   |               6.00|\n|Fumbles                 |-2 points per fumble (if lost)     |              -2.00|\n|FumblesLost             |-2 points per fumble lost          |              -2.00|\n|CompletionsPerAttempt   |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|TDsPerAttempt           |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|InterceptionsPerAttempt |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|TDsPerReception         |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|FumblesLostPerFumble    |Typically not scored (0 points)    |               0.00|\n|FantasyPointsPPR        |NA                                 |                 NA|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTwo different data sets are used, with a focus on three distinct NFL regular seasons - 2022, 2023, and 2024. Both data sets have been scraped but differ in source, purpose, and underlying information present:\n\nData Set 1 - Historical - 2022 & 2023: This data set contains historical data from 2017-2023 for both relevant in-game statistics and fantasy scoring for  regular NFL season. This project primarily focuses on 2022 and 2023. Each observation or row in the data set is a NFL athlete's relevant in-game statistics, such as position, team, completion, attempts, interceptions per attempt, etc. Since most leagues exclude defensive players from their fantasy team, those have been implicitly removed from the data set. The key feature of this data set are the retroactive fantasy rankings/scoring. The total fantasy points, overall rank, and rank by position are available for each player.This allows us to quantify the accuracy of subsequent analysis by enabling the direct comparison of calculated rankings from models to their actual rank.---- This enables the direct comparison of calculated rankings from models to their actual rank ----\n\nPlayers that were on two or more teams in a given season are not assigned a team - but are instead given a makeshift name to highlight this. For example, you may see Baker Mayfield's registered team as `2TM.` One notable variable contained in the data set is ADP, or average draft position, representing the number of times the player was drafted across all recorded leagues before the start of the respective season. Additional variables beyond the data set were calculated based off of existing variables such as Yards Per Rush Attempt, Completions per Attempt, etc. \n\nData Set 2 - Projected - 2024: This data set contains all player match ups for the upcoming regular 2024 NFL season. The in-game statistics recorded for each player are projections based on those teams and match ups. One benefit of this data set is being able to use these projections as inputs of our model to determine which players obtain the most fantasy points, rank them in ascending order, and draft them accordingly. The drawback is that no additional information on how these projections were calculated are known so the accuracy of these projections cannot be confirmed. \n\n# Methods\n\nThe current methodology is to use singular value decomposition of eigenvalues to create scores of new variables that can be attributed to their overall performance. Their projected overall performance would be used to rank each player in ascending order (potentially by position) to inform our draft decision. Starting with the 2022 season, the overall rank for each player is calculated and then compared to the actual ranks of that same year. Precision will be measured in three ways: \n\n1. Difference in overall rank\n2. Difference in position rank\n3. Difference in fantasy points, obtained by taking the difference of fantasy points using our model's draft order with the fantasy points using the ideal draft order.\n\nIf the model is precise, the same 2022 projections will then be tested on 2023. This method is not full-proof obviously. Many things change between off seasons of professional sports, but the objective is to quantify the model's ability to generalize onto future seasons. If it can, the same process will be done starting with the 2023 data set, testing it against itself, then using those scores for 2024. If it does not, principal component scores will be calculated using the 2024 data set only, and only those will inform our draft order. This is not the ideal scenario, since it inherently trusts the projected data. \n\n\n\n\n\n# Preprocessing \n\nMissing values in completions per attempt, tds per attempt, interceptions per attempt, tds per reception, and fumbles lost per fumble were a result of undefined values in the denominator. Observations of this missing values are directly related to the player and position. For example, QBs will rarely record touchdowns per reception and will therefore have undefined values for those statistics since they are more equipped to measure performance of wide receivers. All missing values in these cases were replaced with zero. The same approach was applied to yards per attempt and yards per reception with two notable exceptions. Foster Moreau had zero rushing attempts but two rushing yards during the 2022 NFL season which is difficult to interpret considering rushing attempts are a function of rushing yards. In the same vein, Joe Flacco had -3 receiving yards but zero receptions. Both of these players were removed from the data set. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Processing\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1367\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# YoY PPR Trend for Top NFL Teams\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Year'.

After subsetting the data for the most recent season, the data set was skimmed for a review of distributions, counts, and other elements within the data set. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n:::

These are QBs, WRs, TEs, and RBs. All defensive positions are not scoped and have been explicitly removed from the data set. The objective of this project is to create a fantasy team that has the highest likelihood of obtaining the most Fantasy Points (PPR) for the upcoming season based on prior seasons. The next logical question becomes, does this likelihood vary by team? By position? Intuitively, the likelihood will vary simply based on how many of these positions are in game at a given time. A table of each position shows the distribution of each position in a given NFL season.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n FantasyPosition   n   percent\n              WR 218 0.3791304\n              RB 162 0.2817391\n              TE 113 0.1965217\n              QB  82 0.1426087\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA majority of NFL players in 2022 for fantasy purposes were wide receivers (38%) while the least common position were quarterbacks (14%). For the continuous variables, the important things to note are the means, standard deviations, their counts and distribution via the histograms, and any missing values. In-game stats such as Yards Per Attmept, Yards per Reception, and additional variables (below ADP) are missing for a lot of players as expected. The missing values are likely due to a number of factors such as the position of the player and the number of games each played. The range of games played by each player vary from none to 17, representative of 17 total games in the regular season. The descriptive summary for Fantasy Points (PPR) is: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   vars   n  mean    sd median trimmed   mad  min   max range skew kurtosis\nX1    1 575 78.41 85.43   43.4      64 57.08 -2.9 417.4 420.3 1.38      1.4\n     se\nX1 3.56\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith mu = 78.4 (sd = 85.29), it is obvious that there is high variability. The histogram of PPR shows where how this variability is distributed. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Fantasy-Football_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDepending on the fantasy league, PPR scoring will be different in the sense that there is typically a PPR threshold per game for a player in order for their PPR to be recorded for that given week. If the player is below the baseline, the PPR may be zero. Interestingly enough, the distribution of PPR in 2022 is a log-normal right skew distribution. The observed PPR for most players were approximately zero. This is logical, granted the extreme difficulty of being a top NFL performer. Most players are benched, aren't playing games, nor are starters. Evidently, most of the continuous variables will follow the same trend with observed frequencies ~0 and relatively a fewer number of players scoring the most for each variable. There are three notable exceptions: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Fantasy-Football_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n1. Average Draft Position - Uniform Distribution: For players that have this data available, ADP is uniformly distributed across most players. This implies that the parent population drafts players evenly across the board and there isn't a strong concentration of players being picked predominantly. To reiterate, this is specifically for players that have ADP data available, which may be a combination of the most popular or the best players. \n\n2. Fumbles Lost per Fumble - Bimodal distribution: Frequency of Fumbles Lost per Fumble have peaks at both zero and one, revealing that most players either fumble and lose possession of the ball, resulting in a turnover, or don't fumble at all. \n\n3. Yards Per Reception - Normal distribution: Players average 10 Yards Per Reception with a majority of players within the range of two standard deviations from the mean. Although there is a slight right skew, this is one of the few variables that follows a Gaussian distribution. \n\nThe first thing we want to understand is *what* position, if any, we should be more inclined to draft first, and their likelihood of obtaining the most fantasy points. I started by seeing what the public likes to draft first. In 2022, the public drafted quarterbacks around 86 times on average, the highest of the four positions, with tight ends at a close second of 84 times on average. Running backs and wide receivers then followed. Acknowledging that ADP data is not available for all positions, I wanted to better understand if quarterbacks are the biggest factor in regards to PPR. A comparison of ADP and PPR by position begins to paint the picture. On average, quarterbacks had 105 fantasy points in 22, followed by wide receivers, running backs, then tight ends.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  FantasyPosition AverageDraftPosition AveragePPR\n  <fct>                          <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 QB                              85.8      105. \n2 WR                              73.5       81.6\n3 RB                              61.5       75.7\n4 TE                              83.9       56.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  FantasyPosition     n\n  <fct>           <dbl>\n1 QB               85.8\n2 RB               61.5\n3 TE               83.9\n4 WR               73.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis seems to be consistent at a higher level when the top three teams for the 2022 regular season are compared. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Team'.

Evidently, quarterbacks are disproportionately the most efficient in regard to fantasy points on a per game basis at .164 per game. Running backs, tight ends, and receivers consecutively follow but are significantly behind. However, fantasy points between those three positions vary by less than 5%.  The logical question becomes what are the underlying causes of this variation? One possibility is that there are typically more wide receivers on an offensive play than any other position. Another possibility can be due to the extreme routes and distances wide receivers run, making them injury prone and therefore less efficient. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  FantasyPosition PPRperGame\n  <fct>                <dbl>\n1 QB                  0.164 \n2 RB                  0.0393\n3 TE                  0.0372\n4 WR                  0.0316\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis SVD PCA \n\nEigenvalue decomposition is an unsupervised machine learning method typically used for dimensionality reduction on mostly unlabeled data. The same approach is used here, with the intent to reduce the data to components that measure performance in some aspect. The best way to think about this is in the form of a recipe. A cookbook's recipe for chicken cordon bleu will have elaborate concoctions and mixes of different food. When applied in this context, it would reduce the recipe to its core components, 3/4 chicken, 1/8 cheese, 1/8 ham let's say. It then becomes much easier to make chicken cordon bleu while keeping most of the taste. While an oversimplification, the approach is essentially the same, with the goal of maximizing the amount of underlying variation using linear combinations of variables. At its core, there is some latent underlying variable(s) that combinations of these variables measure. What those underlying variables measure and its relevancy is on us to define. These are the principal components. The principal components are made up of the original variables, and how much that variable contributes (or is a proportion of) to the underlying variable (ie principal component) are the eigen vectors or *loadings*. Loadings can be positive (greatly contributes) or negative (adversely contributes). How well the variables load help define what that new underlying variable is. To define the inclusion criteria, any variable that loads +/- .7 will be considered as loading well and those variables alone will be what is used to define the underlying variable/component. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nA parallel test was used to measure the number of components to obtain. The test performs the same decomposition on simulated data of the same size and graphs the results. Where the simulated and actual data intersect is the cutoff for the number of components to obtain. The results of the test suggest three components. The y-axis plots the eigenvalues which is the total variation explained by each component. In a simpler sense, it can be thought of as the number of original variables accounted for in that component (hence the horizontal line separating values less than one). Three principal components were obtained, acknowledging that principal component one (PC1) should account for approximately six variables, PC2 around 5, and PC3 around 3. The other scree plot better highlights the components as a percentage of total variability explained. Keep in mind that PC1 only accounts for 30% of the total variability and the first three components cumulatively account for 52% of total variability. It's likely that the post-hoc tests described in the methods section will not be sufficient for our goal since there is still half of the total variation not accounted for in these components. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Fantasy-Football_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nParallel analysis suggests that the number of factors =  NA  and the number of components =  3 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Fantasy-Football_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n$$ A * v =  λ * v $$\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Fantasy-Football_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Principal Components\nrotation: maximum variance \n\n**PC1** - \nDefinition: High-Volume QBs\nAttributes: Completions, Attempts, PassingYards, PassingTDs, Interceptions, Fumbles\n\n1. PC1 can be attributed to high-volume QBs as they load extremely well for the above categories. Although pc2 and pc3 are components attributed to the     skill mix of the player/team combination, that is not necessarily the case for this component. If it were, interceptions and fumbles would not be loading   well. All six of these variables though do measure the aggressiveness of the QB. The more attempts made, there will subsequently be more interceptions \nand fumbles. \n  \n**PC2** - \nDefinition: Offensive Efficiency (Long range effeciency):\nAttributes: !GamesStarted, Targets, Receptions, ReceivingYards, ReceivingTDs\n\n2. PC2 can be attributed to total overall offensive effeciency given that we load extremely high for targets, receptions, receiving yards, and receiving    touchdowns. We can make the argument that players typically defined for this category would be wide receivers, and pc2 is measuring yardage efficiency. Efficiency is important in this context given that we also load high to targets, and even though it is not an inclusion criteria in fantasy scoring, it    speaks to the aggressiveness on the offensive side. \n  \n**PC3** - \nDefinition:Driving Efficiency (Short range effeciency):\nAttributes: RushingAttempts, RushingYards, RushingTDs\n\n3. PC3 would be attributed to mainly RBs and TEs that are elite drivers. They load high for rushing stats. These players would also generally be weaker in     long range category. They load below zero for variables in the receiving category such as receivingtds, yardsperreception (so not cathing balls on long     distance plays well). Although using the conservative .7 threshold, these would not be considered as loaded for these categories. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 82 × 4\n    Rank PositionRank Player          FantasyPointsPPR\n   <dbl>        <dbl> <chr>                      <dbl>\n 1     1            1 Patrick Mahomes             417.\n 2     2            2 Josh Allen                  396.\n 3     3            3 Jalen Hurts                 378 \n 4     7            4 Joe Burrow                  351.\n 5    13            5 Geno Smith                  304.\n 6    17            6 Justin Fields               296 \n 7    18            7 Trevor Lawrence             296.\n 8    19            8 Kirk Cousins                292.\n 9    20            9 Daniel Jones                289 \n10    21           10 Jared Goff                  284.\n# ℹ 72 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 82 × 5\n    Rank PositionRank Player          FantasyPointsPPR   pc1\n   <dbl>        <dbl> <chr>                      <dbl> <dbl>\n 1     1            1 Patrick Mahomes             417. 6180.\n 2    24           11 Justin Herbert              281. 5761.\n 3    25           12 Tom Brady                   272. 5760.\n 4    19            8 Kirk Cousins                292. 5477.\n 5     7            4 Joe Burrow                  351. 5365.\n 6    21           10 Jared Goff                  284. 5270.\n 7    13            5 Geno Smith                  304. 5126.\n 8     2            2 Josh Allen                  396. 5095.\n 9    18            7 Trevor Lawrence             296. 4959.\n10    36           13 Aaron Rodgers               239. 4479.\n# ℹ 72 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 82 × 5\n    Rank PositionRank Player          FantasyPointsPPR   pc1\n   <dbl>        <dbl> <chr>                      <dbl> <dbl>\n 1    25           12 Tom Brady                   272.  5.51\n 2    19            8 Kirk Cousins                292.  5.35\n 3     2            2 Josh Allen                  396.  5.12\n 4    24           11 Justin Herbert              281.  5.11\n 5     1            1 Patrick Mahomes             417.  5.03\n 6    18            7 Trevor Lawrence             296.  5.02\n 7    13            5 Geno Smith                  304.  5.01\n 8     7            4 Joe Burrow                  351.  4.94\n 9    36           13 Aaron Rodgers               239.  4.92\n10    21           10 Jared Goff                  284.  4.72\n# ℹ 72 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA Scores: Include all variables in the PCA computation, potentially providing a more comprehensive score but with added complexity.\nHigh-Loading Variables: Offers a simpler approach but might miss some nuanced information captured by less significant variables.\n\n\n# Potential Cluster \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Fantasy-Football_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
