    "text": "Exclusion Criteria\nA waterfall approach was used to define the population of interest. Social-determinants are environmental and non-health related needs such as socio-economic status, that can be attributed to 30-55% of health outcomes1. Payer type was used as a proxy to define parts of ‘disproportionate’ social-determinants, as financial payers like Medicaid insure low-income individuals. Self-pay and Medicaid payers were also included in the drop-down conditions, since this subset of the target population tend to misuse the ER for non-urgent care - a viable proxy for lower health literacy2. Patterns of ER misuse are also more likely to be younger and of non-hispanic black race, however, the only information available an race was whether or not the patient was white. While sub-setting race to only non-whites would align more with the population of interest, this information was retained to maintain the basis of interpretation and prevent over specification of models in the event race was used. The age at which we thought individuals could best understand and articulate aspects of the emergency department setting was 16 years old.

Survey ID 1418129390 had missing admit and discharge times and the encounter record for the survey was dated 1900-01-01. The implied erroneous record was removed.\nTo maintain the integrity of the data set, observations with missing discharge or admit times were removed.\nObservations were subset to those over the age of 16 who were Medicare, Medicaid, or Self-Pay users to isolate the patient population. No demographic attributes were missing in the rest of the survey data.\nRespondents were asked to survey their satisfaction across different care settings across their encounter. The likert scale of possible responses were 1-5.\nFor the non-demographic survey questions, there were a number of questions with missing answers. Survey respondents that had greater than 30% of answers missing were removed from the drop down conditions. Subsequently, survey questions across the sample that had more than 30% of answers missing were also omitted. The questions removed were:\nA87 (Arrival) - Helpfulness of person who first asked you about your condition D2 (Tests) - Courtesy of the person who took your blood D52 (Tests) - Concern shown for your comfort when your blood was drawn\nA new variable was created to measure the length of time between discharge date and the date the survey was received. Survey IDs with negative response times were present, implying that they received the survey before being admitted to the ER. These records were concluded as an error and were also ommitted.\nSurveyors labeled responses based on the following attributes of the patient encounter: Arrival, Personal/Insurance Info, Nurses, Doctors, Tests, Family or Friends, Personal Issues.\nFor any missing responses afterwards, the missing values were replaced with the average satisfaction score for that question.\n\nModel Validation Setup\n\nset.seed(555)\n\n# 70/30 test split \n\nwaterfall %&lt;&gt;% mutate(valid = runif(survey_id,0,1))\ntrain &lt;- waterfall %&gt;%\n  filter(valid &lt;= .7)\ntest &lt;- waterfall %&gt;%\n  filter(valid &gt; .7)\n\ndim(train)\n\n[1] 2049   55\n\ndim(test)\n\n[1] 826  55"

    "text": "Methods\nA regression model was selected to predict the overall patient satisfaction variable, F68, and used to estimate the true population relationship. A 70/30 train:test ratio was used for model validation. Regression assumptions were then validated. For residual normality and increased model accuracy, explanatory variables were transformed before model fitting. The sampling distribution forms a left-skew distribution, in which the square root and natural log transformations were applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserving that the root transformation had the greatest shift to normality, it was applied to all explanatory variables. Additional summary variables based on category were calculated to obtain better predictive variables. The new summary variables were the mean averages for each category.\nPearson’s product correlation matrix was used for variable selection; starting with the highest coefficient of determination, a regression model was fit in progressive steps with one or two variables at a time. At each step, a combination of diagnostic tests and empirical thresholds were used to assess goodness-of-fit based on the following criteria:\n\\[ Δ R^2 = R_f^2 - R_n^2 &gt; .2 \\]\nWhere the additional variable must increase the coefficient of determination by 2% in order for the variable to be retained.\nTurkey’s Nonadditive Test was used to asses presence of interaction. In the context of regression, fitted values squared are computed post-hoc as a quadratic function to test if the interaction term is significantly different from zero, assuming H0: ŷ = 0 and a linear function is modeled with Ha: ŷ ≠ 0 and a non-linear function is modeled:\n\\[\\hat{f_n} = (β_1)\\hat{x_1} + (β_2)\\hat{x_2}+ (β_3)\\hat{x_3}...+(\\hat{y_n})^2\\hat{x_z}\\]\n\\[\\hat{y_n} = (β_1)\\hat{x_1} + (β_2)\\hat{x_2}...+(β_z)\\hat{x_z}\\]\nwhere ŷf are the full predicted values and ŷn are the nested predicted values, variables were retained if P(F) &lt; .05.\nDifference in fits was used to measure the influence of individual observations obtained using an empirical threshold of \\({\\small √(p)/n}\\); where p is the number of parameters and n is the number of observations\nCook’s distance uses leverage and studentized residuals to measure significance of observation on overall model; threshold of 4/n was considered to be practically influential and was further evaluated\nWald Statistic: {\\(β^2/Var(β)\\)} measures the effect size of individual parameters.Variance Inflation Factors greater than four were reevaluated; greater than seven are removed.\nThe model yielding the optimal Δ R2 and least RMSE was used as the production model. The questions used to guide the final model were:\n\nDoes the model capture the true population parameters and relationship? Can the model be used to draw generalizations from our target population?\nIs the model an accurate predictor of patient satisfaction?\n\nThe results of the diagnostic post-hoc tests were then used to assess the models capability to generalize to the target population and decide if a different model would be more equipped to capture the relationships found in survey responses to overall patient satisfaction in ER encounters for those with low social determinants of health. In practice, it is acknowledged that no generalizations can accurately be made on our target population due to the limited information around how the data was collected. It is unknown if the observations were from a random sample, which is sufficient and necessary to make any population conclusions. Any aforementioned hypothesis to the population is for the sake of statistical inference and this endeavor. However, to validate prediction capabilities, a precision grade was used on our test set.\n\n#original model validation setup \nset.seed(555)\n\n# 70/30 test split \n\nwaterfall %&lt;&gt;% mutate(valid = runif(survey_id,0,1))\ntrain &lt;- waterfall %&gt;%\n  filter(valid &lt;= .7)\ntest &lt;- waterfall %&gt;%\n  filter(valid &gt; .7)\n\ndim(train)\n\n[1] 2049   55\n\ndim(test)\n\n[1] 826  55"

Looking at the original data, the former had missing responses for four of the seven questions used to produce the model, highlighting a major flaw in this model - its predictive inaccuracy for patients with missing responses - as missing responses were filled with grand means after exclusion criteria were applied. Although missing at random, a better approach would be to fill in with median values or apply more conservative exclusion factors such as omitting observations with greater than 10% of responses missing. The latter was greatly considered, but the trade-off of small sample sizes and subsequent over fitting were outweighed.\nAfter confirming the absence of variance inflation, the Log Likelihood ratio test was done for the nested model excluding x3, as this was the only non-summary predictor. Wald statistics are limited for linear models such that P(Wald) &gt; P(LRT). Assuming null hypothesis is true where the nested model is just as adequate as the full model, p(χ) = 8.3e-45 (204,2) the affect of x3 on the model is statistically significant.\n\nmodelx &lt;- lm(F68~personal_issues_3+nurses_3, data = train)\n-2*(logLik(modelx)-logLik(model))\n\n'log Lik.' 203.9595 (df=4)\n\npchisq(203,2,lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 8.300611e-45\n\n\n\n(cont.)"

Social-determinants are environmental and non-health related needs such as socio-economic status, that can be attributed to 30-55% of health outcomes [^1]. Payer type was used as a proxy to define parts of ‘disproportionate’ social-determinants, as financial payers like Medicaid insure low-income individuals. Self-pay and Medicaid payers were also included in the drop-down conditions, since this subset of the target population tend to misuse the ER for non-urgent care - a viable proxy for lower health literacy [^2]. Patterns of ER misuse are also more likely to be younger and of non-hispanic black race, however, the only information available an race was whether or not the patient was white. While sub-setting race to only non-whites would align more with the population of interest, this information was retained to maintain the basis of interpretation and prevent over specification of models in the event race was used.

    "text": "Methods\nA regression model was selected to predict the overall patient satisfaction variable, F68, and used to estimate the true population relationship. A 70/30 train:test ratio was used for model validation. Regression assumptions were then validated. For residual normality and increased model accuracy, explanatory variables were transformed before model fitting. The sampling distribution forms a left-skew distribution, in which the square root and natural log transformations were applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserving that the root transformation had the greatest shift to normality, it was applied to all explanatory variables. Additional summary variables based on category were calculated to obtain better predictive variables. The new summary variables were the mean averages for each category.\nPearson’s product correlation matrix was used for variable selection; starting with the highest coefficient of determination, a regression model was fit in progressive steps with one or two variables at a time. At each step, a combination of diagnostic tests and empirical thresholds were used to assess goodness-of-fit based on the following criteria:\n\\[ Δ R^2 = R_f^2 - R_n^2 &gt; .2 \\]\nWhere the additional variable must increase the coefficient of determination by 2% in order for the variable to be retained.\nTurkey’s Nonadditive Test was used to asses presence of interaction. In the context of regression, fitted values squared are computed post-hoc as a quadratic function to test if the interaction term is significantly different from zero, assuming H0: ŷ = 0 and a linear function is modeled with Ha: ŷ ≠ 0 and a non-linear function is modeled:\n\\[\\hat{f_n} = (β_1)\\hat{x_1} + (β_2)\\hat{x_2}+ (β_3)\\hat{x_3}...+(\\hat{y_n})^2\\hat{x_z}\\]\n\\[\\hat{y_n} = (β_1)\\hat{x_1} + (β_2)\\hat{x_2}...+(β_z)\\hat{x_z}\\]\nwhere ŷf are the full predicted values and ŷn are the nested predicted values, variables were retained if P(F) &lt; .05.\nDifference in fits was used to measure the influence of individual observations obtained using an empirical threshold of \\({\\small √(p)/n}\\); where p is the number of parameters and n is the number of observations\nCook’s distance uses leverage and studentized residuals to measure significance of observation on overall model; threshold of 4/n was considered to be practically influential and was further evaluated\nWald Statistic: {\\(β^2/Var(β)\\)} measures the effect size of individual parameters.Variance Inflation Factors greater than four were reevaluated; greater than seven are removed.\nThe model yielding the optimal Δ R2 and least RMSE was used as the production model. The questions used to guide the final model were:\n\nDoes the model capture the true population parameters and relationship? Can the model be used to draw generalizations from our target population?\nIs the model an accurate predictor of patient satisfaction?\n\nThe results of the diagnostic post-hoc tests were then used to assess the models capability to generalize to the target population and decide if a different model would be more equipped to capture the relationships found in survey responses to overall patient satisfaction in ER encounters for those with low social determinants of health. In practice, it is acknowledged that no generalizations can accurately be made on our target population due to the limited information around how the data was collected. It is unknown if the observations were from a random sample, which is sufficient and necessary to make any population conclusions. Any aforementioned hypothesis to the population is for the sake of statistical inference and this endeavor. However, to validate prediction capabilities, a precision grade was used on our test set.\n\n#original model validation setup \nset.seed(555)\n\n# 70/30 test split \n\nwaterfall %&lt;&gt;% mutate(valid = runif(survey_id,0,1))\ntrain &lt;- waterfall %&gt;%\n  filter(valid &lt;= .7)\ntest &lt;- waterfall %&gt;%\n  filter(valid &gt; .7)\n\ndim(train)\n\n[1] 2049   55\n\ndim(test)\n\n[1] 826  55"

The apparent uncaptured variation between the predictor variables calls for models suited for continuous ordinal data such as logistic, poisson, or generalized linear models that can capture different types of distributions.\n\nresidualPlots(model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Test stat Pr(&gt;|Test stat|)\npersonal_issues_3   -1.2853           0.1988\nnurses_3             1.4115           0.1583\nC4_rt                0.0725           0.9422\nTukey test           0.5631           0.5734\n\n\n\ninfluenceIndexPlot(model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmydata %&gt;%\n  filter(survey_id %in% c(1344260683,1439794901))\n\n   survey_id client_short_nm    recdate    disdate er_admit_time er_disch_time\n1 1344260683           NMLFH 2017-06-30 2017-06-30    2017-06-30    2017-06-30\n2 1439794901           NMLFH 2017-11-29 2017-11-27    2017-11-27    2017-11-27\n   distrib language age    sex race_white specialty  unit    payor A4 A5 A86\n1 Internet  ENGLISH  82   Male          1     Acute LF ED Medicare  3  2   4\n2 Internet  ENGLISH  37 Female          0     Acute LF ED Medicaid  5  5   5\n  A87 A2 A3 A28 B1 B3 B4 B5 B76 C1 C2 C4 C5 C75 C7 D2 D3 D4 D52 D65 E1 E2 E3 F4\n1   4  2  2   3  4  3  1  3   3  3  2  1  1   1 NA  4  3  3   3   1  2  1  1  1\n2   5  5  5   5  5  5  5  5   5  5  1  1  1   1  5  5  5  5   5   5  5  5  5  1\n  F68 F1 F2 F41\n1   1 NA NA  NA\n2   1  5  5   1\n\nmydata[mydata$survey_id==1344260683,]\n\n      survey_id client_short_nm    recdate    disdate er_admit_time\n5194 1344260683           NMLFH 2017-06-30 2017-06-30    2017-06-30\n     er_disch_time  distrib language age  sex race_white specialty  unit\n5194    2017-06-30 Internet  ENGLISH  82 Male          1     Acute LF ED\n        payor A4 A5 A86 A87 A2 A3 A28 B1 B3 B4 B5 B76 C1 C2 C4 C5 C75 C7 D2 D3\n5194 Medicare  3  2   4   4  2  2   3  4  3  1  3   3  3  2  1  1   1 NA  4  3\n     D4 D52 D65 E1 E2 E3 F4 F68 F1 F2 F41\n5194  3   3   1  2  1  1  1   1 NA NA  NA\n\n4/dim(train)[1]\n\n[1] 0.001952172\n\n\nSurvey IDs 1344260683 and 1439794901 had the highest influence on the overall model in comparison to the global average of Cook’s distance. Looking at the original data, the former had missing responses for four of the seven questions used to produce the model, highlighting a major flaw in this model - its predictive inaccuracy for patients with missing responses - as missing responses were filled with grand means after exclusion criteria were applied. Although missing at random, a better approach would be to fill in with median values or apply more conservative exclusion factors such as omitting observations with greater than 10% of responses missing. The latter was greatly considered, but the trade-off of small sample sizes and subsequent over fitting were outweighed.\nAfter confirming the absence of variance inflation, the Log Likelihood ratio test was done for the nested model excluding x3, as this was the only non-summary predictor. Wald statistics are limited for linear models such that P(Wald) &gt; P(LRT). Assuming null hypothesis is true where the nested model is just as adequate as the full model, p(χ) = 8.3e-45 (204,2) the affect of x3 on the model is statistically significant.\n\nmodelx &lt;- lm(F68~personal_issues_3+nurses_3, data = train)\n-2*(logLik(modelx)-logLik(model))\n\n'log Lik.' 203.9595 (df=4)\n\npchisq(203,2,lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 8.300611e-45\n\n\n\n(cont.)"

    "text": "Amount and quality of health services received vary substantially across different regions and subgroups within. The cause of this variation does not appear to be a result of differences in social-determinants, and estimates show that 33% of expenditures are unnecessary nor improve population health1. Moreover, in 2021, 5% of the population accounted for nearly half (48.4%) of total health expenditures in the United States2. High-Need High-Cost Patients have been the focus of utilization tracking by all stakeholders. There has been no formal definition to this population, but it is understood by most health experts that 1) they represent a small subset of the population and 2) disproportionately have higher spending than their counterparts. 3The ability to clearly define this subset of the population, observe their health needs, and analyze differences in utilization, spending, and quality of care across various factors and geographic regions can provide additional insight to US health expenditures, drive actionable change, and produce targeted initiatives. The Fee for Service Geographic Variation User File was created by the CMS in efforts to explain the underlying variation in resource use among Medicare beneficiaries across regions and physician practice patterns. It is foundational on CMS’ Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW), a data set containing 100% of Medicare beneficiaries’ enrolled in the fee-for-service claims as well as other enrollment types from 2014-2022. For this reason, it is acknowledged that this is census data. Therefore, generalizations in the form of hypothesis testing and statistical inferences are not used in this analysis. Any observable differences in the graphics or summary statistics have been concluded as differences in the population; standard error(s) measurements have been subsequently omitted."
